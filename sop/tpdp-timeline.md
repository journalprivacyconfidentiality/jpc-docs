Thanks for contributing to TPDP 2018. We would like to invite you to submit a full version of your work "<TITLE>" for a special issue of the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality for TPDP <TPDPYEAR>. All submitted papers will be reviewed accordingly to the standards of regular JPC submissions. 
 
The deadline for submitting your work is **March 15th <TPDPYEAR+1>**. Please submit to the Journal’s submission system at https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions, choose "TPDP 2020" as "Section" so the Journal can route your submission accordingly.
 
The Journal uses a single round of reviews. We will try to speed up the review process by sending each paper to reviewers as soon as they are submitted, and otherwise adhere to the following timetable:

- March 15, <TPDPYEAR+1> Deadline for submission
- May 15, <TPDPYEAR+1> End first round of reviews
- July 1, <TPDPYEAR+1> Deadline final version

If your paper is ready, there is no need to wait the March 15th deadline!
 
In preparing your manuscript please consult the Journal’s submission guidelines as described at

https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions
  
In particular, we encourage authors to use LaTeX, and to use the Journal’s "jpc.cls" for formatting. If your paper will be longer than 20 pages, please consider splitting the paper in two distinct parts: a main manuscript and supplementary material/online appendix.
