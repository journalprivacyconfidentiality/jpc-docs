Hello [name],

As we are ready to prepare your paper for the journal, please upload 
your final LaTeX or Word documents for your paper. 
For LaTeX (preferred), please combine all required *tex and *bib files as a single ZIP. 
You can also share an Overleaf document instead.

While preparing these files, please keep our formatting guidelines, 
available here - https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions - in mind.

Please send these files to my attention at managing-editor@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org, referencing your submission number [number].

Thank you,

[Name]
