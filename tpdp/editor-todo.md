# Behind-the-scenes organization

## Around August

- JPC Exec Editor 
  - creates [section](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/management/settings/context#sections) for **TPDP-{YYYY}** so folks can submit to it.
  - edit the "ex-officio" [appointments](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/management/settings/context) of previous TPDP organizers (remove  some, add new one to current)
  - add new co-chair to the system as a section editor (under [Users](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/management/settings/access), add User (if not present), then add "Section Editor" privilege)

## Around September - October
