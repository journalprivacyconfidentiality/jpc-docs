# jpc-docs

These are template documents for the content of the OJS system. Naming convention corresponds approximately to navigation in the interface under "Settings"

## To modify

- All edits should first be made and reviewed in this directory.
- Pure Markdown should be used, with no fancy HTML.
- Once finalized, the files should be previewed in an appropriate Markdown-to-HTML converter or previewer (e.g., the Preview function in Github or in VSCode).
- Navigate to the relevant page in the OJS system
  - `Settings` -> `Website` -> `Setup` tab -> `Navigation` sub-tab
  - Under `Navigation Menu Items`, find the relevant entry, click on the triangle, and choose `Edit`
  - If no entry exists, `Add an item`, and choose "Custom Page" as the `Navigation Menu Type`
  - Don't forget to `Save`. Changes take effect immediately.
- If adding a new page, also ensure that the page is included in some menu
  - `Settings` -> `Website` -> `Setup` tab -> `Navigation` sub-tab
  - Under `Navigation`, choose the relevant menu (usually `Primary`). Click on the triangle, and choose `Edit`
  - You will be able to arrange the order of items, and add or remove items.
