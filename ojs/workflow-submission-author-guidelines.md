### Files
- In addition to the manuscript (in PDF format), authors should also submit as soon as possible, but no later than when submitting any revisions, a complete LaTeX archive (see below for styling), as a ZIP file.
- Alternatively, authors can **share a Git repository or an Overleaf document** with the Managing Editor, and make a note of the URL in the "Comments to the Editor".

### Formatting 

- While LaTex is the strongly preferred source format, Microsoft Word files will be accepted as well (functionality, such as hyperlinks, will be lost when using Word).
- For LaTeX, use the `jpc.cls` class, which will enforce the rules below. The `jpc.cls` can be downloaded from https://github.com/journalprivacyconfidentiality/jpc-style/releases or as a template on [Overleaf.com](https://overleaf.com).
- The text should
  - be single-spaced;
  - use the same 11pt serif font (e.g. Computer Modern for LaTeX documents, Times New Roman for Word) throughout;
  - use a single column layout with both left and right margins justified;
  - have letter page size (8.5 x 11 inches);
  - have **1.5 inch** top margin, **1.25 inch** left and right margins, and **1 inch** bottom margin
- Use the following document structure:
  - Title page, including Authors, Keywords
  - Abstract
  - Introduction
  - Subsequent sections and subsections that include tables, figures, and footnotes referenced in the text.
  - References
  - Supplementary material (Appendices) see below
- Abstracts should include a brief summary of the main research findings. Avoid generic statements such as "an example is presented". Instead, minimal details about examples should be included, as in, "we illustrate the benefit of our approach by analyzing data on employment from the UK Office of National Statistics".
- Limit abstracts to no more than 300 words, avoid hyperlinks, references, and if possible, LaTeX code.
- Citations can be formatted as you like, provided 
  - the formatting is consistent
  - each citation begins with the last name of the first author
  - where available, DOI and/or URL are listed
- Please consider splitting papers into two distinct parts: a *main manuscript* and *supplementary material*.
  - The main manuscript should be as succinct and readable as possible.
  - The supplementary material can be any length (and in some cases may be unnecessary). The supplementary material may contain additional figures and tables, details about data, mathematical derivations, further explanations, or additional simulations or other supporting studies.  The supplementary material should be formatted using the same stylesheet, and uploaded separately.
- The Journal strongly encourages transparency. Supplementary material, such as data sets, programming code and log files, should be available in an openly accessible repository. Authors should consult the [Journal's Code and Data Availability Policy](/index.php/jpc/management/codedataavailabilitypolicy).
- Figures should be used to help with exposition. Where possible, one or more figures should provide illustrations of main results. These figures may be split into multiple parts. The legend on these figures should have enough detail that someone can get an impression of what is being displayed just by looking at the figure.
- Case studies should make sure to highlight both the main results for privacy and confidentiality from a practical perspective as well as the key methodological contributions in a form accessible to researchers coming to the topic from disciplines other than your own.
- Concluding summaries should be provided only in the context of giving additional perspective on the work.

### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
- It is anticipated that many submitted articles will have appeared in proceedings of peer-reviewed conferences. A copy of the previously published peer-reviewed conference paper or its digital object identifier should be provided on submission. It is the author's responsibility in this case to verify that the submission to the Journal does not conflict with the terms of inclusion in the proceedings.
- Submissions of manuscripts that have been placed in online preprint repositories like arxiv.org and SSRN are allowed provided that they meet the other conditions in these guidelines.
- Authors are the initial owners of the copyrights to their works (an exception in the non-academic world to this might exist if the authors have, as a condition of employment, agreed to transfer copyright to their employer).
- Each author materially contributed to the creation of the paper.
- Submissions will be reviewed according to our [Reviewer Guidelines](/index.php/jpc/reviewer-guidelines).
- Please provide the **ORCID ID** for each author in the submission metadata.
- Please provide any **funding IDs** in the submission metadata, in addition to the acknowledgements in the paper.
