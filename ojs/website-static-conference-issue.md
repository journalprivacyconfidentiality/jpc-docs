## Policy on Conference Issues

The Journal accepts and encourages conference and workshop issues that are related to the Journal's topics of interest. 

### Preparation of conference issues

Parties interested in publishing a conference issue with the Journal should contact the [Managing Editor](mailto:managing-editor@journalprivacyconfidentiality.org) prior to the conference, and at least 4 months prior to the earliest expected publication of the conference issue. At this time, the proposer should designate two or more potential Guest Editors for the conference issue.

### Call for submissions

- Subsequent to the conference or workshop, the proposers should circulate an invitation to submit to the journal to the participants of the conference. They may invite only specific papers or all papers. 
- We strongly suggest that Guest Editors use the [template letter for invitation to submit].
- An open call for submissions on the topic will be posted on the Journal website. The call is open to anybody, including non-participants in the workshop, as long as the submission is within the scope of the call for papers. 

### Submission guidelines

- All submissions should be in LaTeX. Conversion from other formats can be handled, but cost for such conversion is to be handled by the proposers of the special issue.
- Submission guidelines are described at https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions. If there is a separate conference proceedings, we note that there are required minimal supplementary content to qualify for a conference issue of JPC. 
- All submitted papers will be reviewed according to the standards of regular JPC submissions.

### Handling of submissions

- The proposers of the special issue should designate two or more Guest Editors. 
- The Journal will designate one or more members of the Editorial Board who will responsible for oversight of the process. When the special issue is associated with a conference or workshop, it is expected that these Guest Editors attend the conference or workshop.
- Guest Editors are also responsible for submissions to the special issue that do not stem from conference participants. Should the number of such submissions be large, Guest Editors or members of the Editorial Board may handle some of these.
- GUest Editors handle the choice of reviewers, and recommend a decision for each submitted paper.
  - [Reviewer guidelines](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/reviewer-guidelines) are available on the JPC website.
- Recommendations are reviewed and approved by the Editor in Chief of JPC.
  - [Reviewing policies](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/policies#reviewing-process) and [Conflict of interest rules](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/policies#journal-policies-on-conflicts-of-interest-competing-interests) apply.

### Publication 

- The accepted manuscripts will be published in a special issue dedicated to the topic/conference. 
- Effective with conference issues proposed after April 1, 2025, the JPC's publication fee of $500 will apply to each accepted manuscript.
- Should the number of accepted manuscripts not be sufficient for a full issue, they will be published as part of a designated section of the next regular issue. This may also happen when there is a sufficiently large number of manuscripts, but delays in the reviewing process are too long - the manuscripts from the special issue may then be split across designated sections of multiple regular issues. 
- A special issue should have at least 6 manuscripts. There is no upper limit.
- A special section of a regular issue can have any number of manuscripts.
- The Guest Editors should write an editorial for the special issue, or the first issue containing a special section, summarizing the context and the published papers.
