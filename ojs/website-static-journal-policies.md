Every editor will seek at least two timely expert opinions for submissions. Peer review is **single-blind**: The authors' names are not blinded, the reviewers' names are kept confidential. The **reviewer guidelines** are [posted on our website](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/reviewer-guidelines). 

### Timeliness of Peer-Review Process

## Copyright and Licensing

The Journal's copyright policy is stated [on our Submission page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions).

By submitting to this journal, the author(s) license the article under the ]Creative Commons License – Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0), unless choosing a more lenient license (for instance, public domain).


## Process for identification of and dealing with allegations of research misconduct

The Journal and its editors strongly discourage any attempt at plagiarism, citation manipulation, and data falsification/fabrication, among others. If we detect such behavior, or are made aware of any allegation of research misconduct relating to a published article in their journal, we shall follow [COPE’s guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines) in dealing with allegations. 

## Publication Ethics
The Journal adheres to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) [Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/principles-transparency-and-best-practice-scholarly-publishing). In particular:

### Journal policies on authorship and contributorship

The Journal requires that each author is aware of the contents of the entire article and its submission status, and each author materially contributed to the creation of the paper (see [Submission page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions). The submitting author explicitly confirms this, on behalf of all authors, upon submission. 

### Complaints and appeals

Should authors have complaints about the behavior of any Journal editor, reviewer, or staff member, they should first attempt to contact the Managing Editor (see [Contact page](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/contact)). Should that not resolve the issue, the complainant may contact [COPE](https://publicationethics.org) or the Managing Editor's employer. 

### Journal policies on conflicts of interest / competing interests

Editors who have a conflict of interest with a submission recuse themselves from the editorial process. An alternate editor is then assigned. Editors may themselves be authors on submissions to the Journal, but are excluded from all aspects of the editorial workflow. 

Authors are encouraged, but not required to state any competing interests at the time of submission. 

### Journal policies on data sharing and reproducibility

The Journal strongly encourages transparency. The Journal’s [Code and Data Availability Policy](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/codedataavailabilitypolicy) is part of the [Submission Guidelines](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/about/submissions).

### Other policies
The Journal does not have explicit policies on ethical oversight or on intellectual property.

### Options for post-publication discussions and corrections

The Journal does not host any forum for post-publication discussions. We may, subject to our Submission Guidelines, publish comments or discussions of articles published in the Journal. Authors may request corrections to their articles, which will be posted in addition to the original manuscript. Articles may be retracted, in which case a notice will replace the manuscript. 


## Archiving

The Journal subscribes to [CLOCKSS](https://clockss.org/), the community governed and supported digital preservation archive for scholarly content. The Journal is also archived on the [WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc/index). Most of the Journal's manuscripts are also available on non-public Github repositories at [https://github.com/journalprivacyconfidentiality](https://github.com/journalprivacyconfidentiality) in LaTeX source code.
